Kodi Artwork Organizer (TechErudio Fork, v6.1.2)

This is a forked version of the Kodi Artwork Organizer 6.1.1. Why the update? I noticed when I installed 6.1.1 on Kodi Nexus 20.1, 
the movie posters weren't being saved, and only saving the thumbnails grabbed from the video.
So, I've added the ability to download movie posters using Kodi Nexus 20.1+

I have named this version 6.1.2. If the original maintainer wants to merge these changes back into the main branch, I'm perfectly fine with it :-)

Note: I did not go through all of the language strings. If your language is missing, after installing, you can edit the strings.po file under /resources/language/resource.language.[xx] and add...

msgctxt "#32006"
msgid "Copy Movie Posters"
msgstr "insert your language here"
